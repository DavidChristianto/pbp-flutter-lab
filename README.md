# counter_7

A new Flutter project.

## =============== ASSIGNMENT 7 ===============

## 1. Explain what is meant by stateless widget and stateful widget and explain the difference between them.
## Answer: 

In Flutter there are only 2 types of widgets, namely Stateful Widgets and Stateless Widgets.
A widget's state is stored in a State object, separating the widget's state from its appearance. Stateful Widgets have mutable objects and can change state, in other words they are dynamic. One example is when changing the appearance in response to user interaction or when receiving data. Examples of Stateful Widgets are Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField. While Stateless Widgets are widgets that do not have a state object, meaning that they do not follow the existing state changes or cannot be changed. One example of a Stateless Widget is Icon, IconButton, and Text.

## 2. Mention what widgets you use in this project and explain their functions
## Answer:
a. Stateless Widget for construct UI (user interface)
b. myApp have role as root of Widget
c. StatefulWidget for makes the buttons and the logic
d. appBar as navbar in the app
e. Scaffold for create the structure layout visually
f. Center for adjust the position child in the center of parent
g. Column for arrange layout Widget vertically
h. Row for arrange layout Widget horizontally
i. Container for wrapp the elements and add it to margin
j. FloatingActionButton for adding the button
k. Text for makes the texts

## 3. What is the function of setState()? Explain what variables can be affected by the function.
## Answer:
setState() in fluter is a function to know the framework when the internal situation of an object changes, which causes the framework to set a schedule for the construction of that object. Or it can also be interpreted that setSet is a method used to make changes to the stateful widget state. Without setStateva there is a possibility that the changes that occur cannot be detected by the UI. And on the task I created, setState is implemented in counterStateProvider.

## 4. Explain the difference between const and final
## Answer:
Dart supports assigning constant values ​​to variables using 2 keywords, namely the const keyword and the final keyword. This keyword is used to keep a variable's value static throughout the codebase, meaning that once a variable is defined, its state cannot be changed.

The final keyword is used to hardcode the values ​​of the variable and it cannot be altered in future, neither any kind of operations performed on these variables can alter its value (state).

The Const keyword in Dart behaves exactly like the final keyword. The only difference between final and const is that const keeps the variable constant from compile time only. while final at run-time.

## 5. Explain how you implement the checklist above.
## Answer:
1. export PATH=/Users/christianto09/Flutter/flutter/bin:$PATH run this command on terminal first
2. create flutter create with command flutter create
3. cd to the app that create before
4. flutter run to check the app is ok
5. open android studio to edit the code, (add flutter_riverpod: ^2.1.1 to pubspec.yaml because I use import import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';)
6. Edit the code according to request assignment
7. flutter run again to check the app satisfy the request
8. quit
9. git add, commit, push
10. Answer the readme.md

## =============== ASSIGNMENT 8 ===============

## 1. Explain the difference between Navigator.push and Navigator.pushReplacement.
## Answer:
Navigator.push and Navigator.pushReplacement are included in Flutter navigation routing. The main difference between the two is

a.Navigator.push (): This is a push method that is used to add another route to the top of the current screen stack (stack), so that the new page is displayed above the previous page.

b. Navigator.pushReplacement : Is a push method that adds a new route to the navigation stack and will delete the current route by removing the previous route once added.

## 2. List all the widgets you used in this project and explain their functions.
## Answer: 
a. Stateless Widget for construct UI (user interface)
b. myApp have role as root of Widget
c. StatefulWidget for makes the buttons and the logic
d. appBar as navbar in the app
e. Scaffold for create the structure layout visually
f. Center for adjust the position child in the center of parent
g. Column for arrange layout Widget vertically
h. Row for arrange layout Widget horizontally
i. Container for wrapp the elements and add it to margin
j. FloatingActionButton for adding the button
k. Text for makes the texts
l. Drawer is a widget that provides a menu that can be pulled out by click the icon
m. Padding is a wrapper that provides padding properties
n. Form has the ability to validate and save their contents and contains inputs
o. TextFormField is kind of form for textfield
p. Dropdown button for make dropdown form
q. Navigator have functions for manages page using stack

## 3. Name the types of events that exist in Flutter 
## Answer:
a. onPressed is using for handle the case of pressing button
b. onSaved is to handle the event that call the method  when the form saved via FormState.save
c. onChanged is to handle the event where the contents of widget changes
d. onEditingComplete is an event to handle when user submits the editable contents
e. onTap is an event where a widget is tapped

## 4. Explain how the Navigator works in "switching" pages of a Flutter application.
## Answer:
Navigator works to manage elements with routes that display content pages in flutter.

The navigator itself consists of 3 parts, namely the stack, the pop method which will remove the topmost section and the navigation will display the previous page, and the push method which will navigate to a new page.

in simple terms this is the mechanism of how the navigator works in page switches in flutter.

## 5. Explain how you implemented the checking list above.
## Answer:
1. run set path on terminal
2. open android studio to edit counter_7
3. add new file in lib which is form.dart for adding budget info and data.dart for budget data, also drawer.dart
4. adding code in the lab for the form.dart and use static method to load data into data.dart and also adding date picker form google(https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showDatePicker.html)
5. make card widget in data.dart
6. adding listtile in drawer.dart using code in the lab
7. do readme
8. git add, commit, push.

## =============== ASSIGNMENT 9 ===============

## 1. Can we retrieve JSON data without creating a model first? If yes, is it better than creating a model before retrieving JSON data?
## Answer:
In my opinion, we can still retrieve Json data without having to make a model first (for example using a global variable), but it is advisable to create a model first with the consideration of simplifying the syntax and also making the code structure better organized

## 3. Explain the mechanism of retrieving data from json so it can be shown in Flutter.
## Answer:
